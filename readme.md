# Welcome to the source code
If you want to add a page to the site, create a github account, and ask to be added as a collaborator.  
Then ``git pull https://github.com/munsterscioly/munsterscioly.github.io`` and ``git push`` when you're done.  Make sure to push to master.  
If you *really* wanted to, you could actually even edit files in github's editor and commit them immediately, but these changes are hard to test and should not be relied on.
